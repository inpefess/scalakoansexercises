# Scalakoans Exercises

My first steps in studying Scala. I did them many years ago. They were originally hosted [here](http://bitbucket.org/dickwall/scala-koans/wiki/Home). The code was migrated from `mercurial` to `git`, so there can be some discrepancies. For more details better consult the original koans.
